Montreal All-Girl Hack Night
=========

You should come if
-----------
you're a woman & you like writing code & you want to write code around / hang out with other women who write code

Who we are
-----------

We're female developers in Montreal. We decided that Montreal needs another event for female developers 
to hang out, talk technology, and hack on cool projects.

Bring yourself, your vexing technical problems, and your expertise!  If you feel like coding, bring a laptop. 
We provide food, internet and witty banter.

If you're interested in giving a talk at a future meetup or have any other suggestions, questions, 
or photos of cats you'd like to share, [email us](mailto: mtlallgirlhacknight@gmail.com)
