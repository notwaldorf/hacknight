      We're female developers in Montreal. We decided that Montreal needs
      another event for female developers to hang out, talk technology, and hack
      on cool projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bring yourself, your vexing technical problems, and your expertise!  If
      you feel like coding, bring a laptop. We provide food, internet and witty banter.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're interested in giving a talk at a future meetup or have any other
      suggestions, questions, or photos of cats you'd like to share, <a
        href="mailto:mtlallgirlhacknight@gmail.com">email us</a>. You can also follow us on 
        <a href="https://twitter.com/mtlgirlhackers">twitter</a> for updates.
    </p>
    <p><b>Organizers: </b> <a href="https://github.com/jvns">Julia</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf">Monica</a></p>

        We will feed you pizza!  There will be vegetarian food but not vegan or
        gluten-free options.  Email us if this is a problem for you and we'll
        see what we can do in future events.

        Not this time. We can organize some group-pizza-ordering if people are hungry.

        We don't have any ability to provide childcare, so it's best if you
