Looking for some ideas of projects to work on? Here's a long list of ideas for
inspiration. Try any of these in any programming language you want! Or,
preferably, read this list, say "all these ideas are dumb! I have a way better
idea!" and then do that.


Programming languages
---------------------

Want learn something about a new programming language? Try doing anything below
in one of {go, lisp, clojure, python, ruby, java, c++, c, javascript, haskell,
erlang, postscript, perl, prolog, smalltalk, INTERCAL, ActionScript}

Some kinds of languages you might not have used before:

- Functional languages: Haskell, Clojure, Lisp, OCaml
- Stack-based languages: Postscript
- Graphical languages: Processing
- Logic programming languages: Prolog
- Languages where you have to say 'please': INTERCAL
- Concurrent programming langues: Erlang, Go
- Assembly languages

Music & animations & games
--------------------------

    - generate midi files to create music
    - make a simple game -- snake or frogger
        - javascript/python (using pygame) are good choices for this
    - make animations (maybe with CSS3?)
        - rotating cube / molecules / circles bouncing around the screen / infinitely growing fractal
        - ants crawling around the screen
        - eyes that follow the mouse around the screen
        - a double pendulum (a pendulum attached to a pendulum)
        - implement your favorite screensaver
    - write a text adventure (like the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy)
    - Make videos from your instagram/flickr photos
    - make a web version of your favorite board game (copyright issues may
      apply)
    - write a multiplayer game server

Web development
---------------
    - make a website using a web framework {django, rails, flask, grails,
      yesod, node, compojure}
    - make yourself a personal website
    - make an animation with the javascript visualization
    - make yourself a dashboard homepage with dashing:
      http://dashingdemo.herokuapp.com/sample,
      http://shopify.github.com/dashing/
    - make a presentation using impress.js
    - Display things on a map using google maps or openstreetmap or textile
    - here is a cool usenet post from 1999 with some ideas: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.sys.mac.programmer.games/SXjW24vP-AQ

Playing with data
-----------------
    - NASA images-of-the-day
    - STM data: http://www.stm.info/english/en-bref/a-developpeurs.htm
    - Ville de Montreal - http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/
        - (images, bike paths, library books, traffic lights, parking, garbage collection dates, ...)
    - Yahoo! Answers http://developer.yahoo.com/answers/
    - Github data http://developer.github.com/v3/
    - Transcripts from Parliament http://openparliament.ca/api/
    - All kinds of machine learning datasets are available here:
      http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/
    - Download all your emails from gmail/hotmail and find out what kinds of
      things you say the most
    - http://montrealouvert.net/
    - Do some of the competitions on Kaggle
